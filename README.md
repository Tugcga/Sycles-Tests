This is a separate repository of render tests for the [Sycles](https://github.com/Tugcga/Sycles) addon for Softimage. All test scenes are contained in the **scenes** directory. Each test has a **ref.png** file with a reference render result. Main function of **render_test.py** renders each scene using batch rendering and compares the resulting output image with the reference one. If the images are too different, the exception is thrown.
